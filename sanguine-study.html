        <h3 class="m-b">Intro to Sanguine</h3>
        <p>
          Sanguine is a biotech company that at the time of my employment was focused on improving in-home clinical trials in two ways: Recruit patients with digital marketing and developing technology to aid in collecting samples from patients in their homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My time at Sanguine was spent helping to create their mobile phlebotomy app Sangre and improving their patient sign up process.

        <p>
          Below will show the process used when designing and developing products at Sanguine, showing examples of multiple projects.
        </p>
        <h5>Planning and Flowcharts:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          During the product planning phase we would discuss the ideal user flow and I would create a flowchart (below). 
        </p>

        <h5>Wireframing:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          After finishing the user flow I would create wireframes using Balsamiq to help get the functionality and feature discussion going with the developers and graphic designers.

      </div>

        <h5>Finished Designs:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          During the design process I would would hand off my wireframes or sometimes create designs with placeholders for images to our graphic designers. I would work with them closely giving feedback and making some UX decision along the way until we had the final design.
