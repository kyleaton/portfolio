        <p>
          Leapcure is a health tech company I've cofounded and is backed by 500 Startups. Our mission is to accelerate clinical trials by expediting patient recruitment and empowering researchers.

        <h3 class="m-b">Role: VP Product and Growth</h3>
        <p>
          My role at Leapcure is to drive the user experience, both patient and client facing, and manage our growth machine.

        <h3>Process (UX)</h3>
        <h5>Problem:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Clinical trials aren’t meeting their deadlines. This wastes time, money and potential treatments for people in need. 
        </p>

        <h5>Discovery:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          As a team, we researched the stated problem and have also had first hand experience with the lack of efficiency in clinical trials professionally and personally. What struck us as the best starting point in solving this problem was addressing patient recruitment.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Most clinical trial websites have poor and outdated user experiences. Patients must complete extensive forms with information that doesn’t necessarily qualify or disqualify them from a study. Further, if patients want to sign up for a different study, they must re-submit additional forms with identical information. This wastes valuable time. 
        </p>

        <h5>Proposed Solution:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Develop a patient on-boarding process that intelligently routes patients to multiple studies that are qualified for in a single, streamlined submission, without repeat questions and forms. 
        </p>

        <h5>Whiteboarding and Flowcharts:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Flow charts were created using whiteboarding sessions followed by the design of low fidelity mock-ups with Sketch, flushing out functionality and features. 
        </p>

        <h5>Polished Design & Prototyping:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          After confirming features and functionality, I created a polished mock-up of the app and the team developed a MVP version to attain user feedback.

        <h5>Event Tracking Implementation:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Using a combination of Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Inspectlet we are able to set up trackable success funnels and user segments. The data pulled from these products allow us to quickly locate what steps in the funnel are problematic for users from a high level. Once this problem is diagnosed, we then take a much closer look with user videos from Inspectlet to view the issue action from the users perspective. This step is crucial to driving the design of the product and solving bugs.
        </p>

        <h5>Initial Testing:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          The MVP product, along with a survey requesting feedback, was sent to 300+ users. Those surveys, in conjunction with one on one conversations with these participants, led to improvements to the user experience.
        </p>

        <h5>Current Progress:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          The product has been live now for over a year and has recruited hundreds of patients successfully <strong>10x faster</strong> than the industry norm. The UX of the on-boarding piece of product has continued to evolve due to the user data collected through our third party applications.

        <h3 class="m-b">500 Startups Experience & The Growth Machine</h3>
        <p>
          Being a part of 500 Startups Batch 18 was a tremendous experience. Working alongside 40 other companies sharing successes, failures and strategy, along with access to brilliant mentors who have had success in UX and growth, proved to be truly invaluable. I could go on and on about my take-aways, but learning how to create and manage a growth machine was the most captivating and critical.
        </p>
        <h5>Growth Machine:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          The growth machine is strategy that is pushed by the 500 Startups team heavily. Its goal is to increase the key metric you are focusing on by experimenting as frequently and efficiently as possible in an organized and detailed fashion. Here’ a tl;dr version of the process:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li> Brainstorm with your team</li>
          <li> Comb through the ideas and score them by:</li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Potential Impact</li>
              <li>Confidence in achieving the possible impact (I’ve seen someone do this before, I’ve done this before, etc...)</li>
              <li>Time & money spent to execute</li>
            </ol>
          <li> Select the ideas with the best score until the team's bandwidth full</li>
          <li> After experiments have concluded, report success in improving the target metric and determine:</li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Can we improve the experiment?</li>
              <li>Is it worth repeating or repeatable at all?</li>
            </ol>
          <li> Include your best repeatable experiments into your growth playbook.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="m-x m-t-md">
          The start-up of this process takes some getting used to but once it has momentum it is truly effective. As you continues to run experiments, the team will get increasingly better at scoring ideas and understanding their true output potential. This process makes on-boarding new employees easy and creates wonderful transparency for the company, avoiding silos.
