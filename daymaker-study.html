        <p>
          Leapcure is a 500 startups backed health tech company I’ve cofounded. Our mission is to accelerate clinical trials by finding the right patients faster along with empowering researchers to making them more efficient. We will be focusing on one piece of the Leapcure puzzle here.

        <h3 class="m-b">Role: VP Product and Growth</h3>
        <p>
          My role at Leapcure is to drive the user experience (patient and client facing) and manage our growth machine.

        <h3>Process (UX)</h3>
        <h5>Problem:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          My role at Leapcure is to drive the user experience (patient and client facing) and manage our growth machine. 
        </p>

        <h5>Discovery:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          As a team we did research on this problem and have had first hand experience with the lack of efficiency in clinical trials. What stuck out to us as the best starting point to solve the problem was tackling patient recruitment.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Most websites where you can sign up for clinical trials have very poor and outdated user experiences. You have to fill out massive forms with information that doesn’t necessarily qualify or disqualify you from a study and if you want to sign up for a different study you have to fill out a form with the same exact information all over again, wasting so much time. 
        </p>

        <h5>Proposed Solution:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Create a patient on-boarding process that intelligently routes you to just the studies you qualify for and answering the questions you have to only one time.
        </p>

        <h5>Whiteboarding and Flowcharts:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Created flow charts and some designs on whiteboards then low fidelity mockups using Sketch to help flush out functionality and features (I’ve blurred parts for IP purposes). 
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="image-holder width100 left m-y-md">
        <strong><p>Whiteboarding User Flows</p></strong>

       <div class="row left width100 m-t-lg">
        <h5>Polished Design & Prototyping:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          After confirming features and functionality, I create a polished mock up of the app and we create a MVP version to test out the UX.

      <div class="row left width100 m-t-lg">
        <h5>Event Tracking Implementation:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Using a combination of Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Inspectlet we are able to set up trackable success funnels and user segments. The data pulled from this allows us to quickly locate the problem in the funnel from a high level then dive down deep with user videos from Inspectlet to see the issue in action. This step is crucial to driving the design of the product.
        </p>

        <h5>Initial Testing:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          The MVP product along with a feedback survey was sent out to 300+ people. Those surveys plus  one on one conversations with the recipients of the MVP lead to some adjustments to the UX.
        </p>

        <h5>Current Progress:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          The product has been live now for over a year and has recruited hundreds of patients successfully <strong>10x faster</strong> than competitors. The UX of the on-boarding piece of product has since guided by the user data collected through our third party apps.

        <h3 class="m-b">500 Startups Experience & Growth Machine</h3>
        <p>
          Being a part of 500 startups batch 18 was an amazing experience. Working alongside 40 other companies and being able to share successes, failures and learns along with access to brilliant mentors who have succeeded in UX and growth proved to be truly invaluable. I could go on and on about my take aways but learning how to create and manage a growth machine is still my favorite and I feel most valuable.
        </p>
        <h5>Growth Machine:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          The growth machine is something that is pushed by the 500 distro team heavily. The goal of it is to increase the key metric you are focusing on by experimenting as frequently and efficiently as possible in an organized fashion. Here’ a tl;dr version of the process:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li> Brainstorm with your team.</li>
          <li> Comb ideas and score them by:</li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Potential Impact</li>
              <li>Confidence in achieving the possible impact (I’ve seen someone do this before, I’ve done this before, etc.)</li>
              <li>Time/Money</li>
            </ol>
          <li> Choose the ideas with the best score until bandwidth is full for those responsible.</li>
          <li> After experiments have concluded interpret success and determine:</li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Can we improve the experiment.</li>
              <li>Is it worth repeating / repeatable.</li>
            </ol>
          <li> Include your best repeatable experiments into your playbook.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="m-x m-t-md">
          Getting this process up and running takes some getting used to but once it has momentum its so effective. This process makes on-boarding new employees easy and creates wonderful transparency for the company, avoiding silos.
