        <h3 class="m-b">Intro to Daymaker</h3>
        <p>
          Daymaker is the friend that always knows the cool new restaurant, bar or event that’s happening. It helps you find things to do, but more than that — it will create an entire itinerary for you, lasting anywhere from a couple of hours to an entire day. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Itineraries take into account things like meal times, operating hours and location, ensuring that each day will make sense. They also include easy links to purchase tickets where necessary, and instant directions to each item on your agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daymaker makes planning a great day easy. It also makes it fun.

        <h3>Process (UX)</h3>
        <h5>Problem:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Finding things to do, even in the city you live in, is a challenge and more so when traveling to a new city. Just to find an event users open copious tabs from multiple websites. If they want to find something to eat or drink before or after the event they open up yelp and go through the same process.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Just the discovery process for things to do is a long arduous task and then you need to consider the logistics of timing travel, buying tickets and making reservations. 
        </p>

        <h5>Proposed Solution:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Create something that not only helps you find the best things to do, see, eat and drink but also create a perfect itinerary including those things.
        </p>

        <h5>Discovery, Testing and a Pivot:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Before diving head first into what Daymaker is today we spent hours in many brainstorming sessions thinking about how people plan their days. 
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Originally we came up with 20 question survey where you select your preference between two events at a time (e.g., A rock concert or an opera). Based on your answers, we would send you restaurants, events and other things to do.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          We received positive feedback but we wanted to think of something more ambitious.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          That’s when we came up with the idea of creating a tool that help you discover things to do and create a perfect itinerary with those discoveries.
        </p>
        <h5>Proposed Solution:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          After creating a few different mock ups of this idea we eventually decided to create an experience similar to video poker. Instead of being dealt cards you get events, keeping the events you want and getting rid of the ones you don't until you have a perfect “hand” or itinerary.

        <h5>Polished Design & Prototyping:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
         After coming to a consensus on features and functionality, I created more polished designs that an engineer and I started developing.
         While we were developing, I created a landing page showing the functionality of the app with images and animations along with a form asking for emails from users who were interested in the product and wanted to be notified when it was released.

        <h5>Event Tracking Implementation:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Using a combination of Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Inspectlet we are able to diagnose problems within the user experience efficiently. The data we obtain from these applications allow us to make very educated decision on how to improve the product. Here’s how:
        </p>  
        <p class="m-x">
          <strong>Google Analytics (top of the funnel):</strong> We use Google Analytics mostly to track the success of our acquisition methods (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Google search, etc). By using UTM tags in our links we can see which ads or social media posts acquire the most users.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          <strong>Mixpanel (mid to bottom of funnel):</strong> Mixpanel is great for tracking user activity once they started to interact with your site. We use Mixpanel to see which steps in the funnel, from landing on the page to signing up, users are having trouble with.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          After users have signed up, you can segment users by how they interact with the site, their location, what ad brought them in and use those segments to send more personalized messages through Mixpanel to help re-engage your users.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          <strong>Inspectlet (User videos):</strong> Inspectlet takes videos of sessions on the site. After recognizing a problem in the funnel using Mixpanel, I would watch these sessions and see what exactly the user is having problems with. This really helps us conclude if we have a technical problem or a design problem.
        </p>

        <h5>Initial Testing:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          We set up some Facebook ads to get performance data through Google Analytics, Mixpanel and our A/B tests, but what we learned the most from in a short period of time and a limited ad budget was a service called Userbrain.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Userbrain is a service where you can give a prompt to testers (e.g., "Click around the website tell us what you think it does.") and you watch the tester use your product while they think out loud and give feedback.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Feedback on the product was very positive and the testers tended to be very enthusiastic about it.
        </p>

        <h5>Diagnosising Low Key Metric Results:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          After putting the core idea of the product live (the day creation tool plus saved itineraries) we noticed our key metric, email submissions, was not meeting our goal. while diving analytics I found that our successful users started to engage with the product in the way that we intended after two or three minutes of use. This is a very long time to maintain user attention and interest, it is much more likely someone would bounce in that time than stick around and learn something new.
        </p>
        <h5>Solving The Issue:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          In order for us to get emails we needed users to save an itinerary which, as explained above, takes a good bit of effort.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          The decision to solve this was to create other reasons for users to give us their emails sooner, along with showing them value before reaching the day creation tool. We decided to implement features that users are accustom to seeing in our industry, giving them comfort in familiarity.
        </p>
        <h5>New Features:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          In creating the new features we wanted to help acquisition along with boosting our engagement and retention metrics.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          With acquisition in mind we created event pages, venue pages and “Best Things to do…” type blogs. These pages not only function as attractive content for advertising and sharing on social media platforms but also succeeded in increasing our SEO greatly, giving us some page one results on Google.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Focusing on retention, we created a weekly email sending users the best events for each week and the ability to “favorite” events, blogs, and venues to a user dashboard for later day planning. Favoriting any piece of content requires a user to sign up and give us their email.
        </p>
