        <p>
          Daymaker is the friend that always knows the cool new restaurant, bar or event that’s happening. It helps you find things to do, but more than that — it will create an entire itinerary for you, lasting anywhere from a couple of hours to an entire day. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Itineraries take into account factors like meal times, operating hours and location, ensuring that each day will make sense. They also include easy links to purchase tickets where necessary, and instant directions to each item on your agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daymaker makes planning a great day easy. It also makes it fun.

        <h3>Process (UX)</h3>
        <h5>Problem:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Finding things to do, even in the city you live in, is a challenge and even more so when traveling to a new city. To find a single event, users open copious tabs from multiple websites. If they want to find something to eat or drink before or after the event they open up Yelp and undergo the same process.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          The discovery process for things to do is a long arduous task and then you need to consider the logistics of timing travel, buying tickets and making reservations. 
        </p>

        <h5>Proposed Solution:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Create something that not only helps you find the best things to do, see, eat and drink but also create a perfect itinerary including those things.
        </p>

        <h5>Discovery, Testing and a Pivot:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Before diving head first into what Daymaker is today, we spent hours in many brainstorming sessions conceptualizing how people plan their days. 
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Originally we came up with a 20 question survey in which you select your preference between two events at a time (e.g., a rock concert or an opera). Based on your answers, we would send you restaurants, events and other things to do.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          We received positive feedback but we wanted to think of something more ambitious.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          That’s when we came up with the idea of creating a tool that helps you discover things to do and create a perfect itinerary with those discoveries.
        </p>
        <h5>Proposed Solution:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          After creating a few different mock ups of this idea we eventually decided to create an experience similar to video poker. Instead of being dealt cards you get events, keeping the events you want and getting rid of the ones you don't until you have a perfect “hand” or itinerary.

          After reaching a consensus on features and functionality, I created more polished designs that an engineer and I began developing. While we were developing, I created a landing page showing the functionality of the app with images and animations, along with a form asking for emails from interested users.

        <h5>Event Tracking Implementation:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          Using a combination of Google Analytics, Mixpanel and Inspectlet we are able to diagnose problems within the user experience efficiently. The data we obtain from these applications allow us to make educated decisions on how to improve the product. Here’s how:
        </p>  
        <p class="m-x">
          <strong>Google Analytics (top of the funnel):</strong> Google Analytics is used to track the success of our acquisition methods (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Google search, etc). By using UTM tags in links, the ads or social media posts that acquire the most users are identified.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          <strong>Mixpanel (mid to bottom of funnel):</strong> Mixpanel is great for tracking user activity once interaction is initiated with the site. Mixpanel is used to see which steps in the funnel, from landing on the page to signing up, users are having trouble with.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          After users have signed up, segmentation of users based on how they interact with the site, their location, what ad brought them in can occur. These segments can be utliized in order to send more personalized messages through Mixpanel to help re-engage the users.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          <strong>Inspectlet (User videos):</strong> Inspectlet records videos of sessions on the site. After recognizing a problem in the funnel using Mixpanel, these sessions are reviewed to understand what exactly the user is having difficulties with. This helps conclude if there is a technical problem or a design problem.
        </p>

        <h5>Initial Testing:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          We set up some Facebook ads to get performance data through Google Analytics, Mixpanel and our A/B tests, but we learned the most from in a short period of time and a limited ad budget was a service called Userbrain.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Userbrain is a service with which you can provide a prompt to testers (e.g., "Click around the website and tell us what you think it does.") and you can subsequently observe the tester use the product while they think out loud and give feedback.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Feedback on the product was very positive and the testers tended to be enthusiastic about it.
        </p>

        <h5>Diagnosising Low Key Metric Results:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          After putting the core idea of the product live (the day creation tool plus saved itineraries) we noticed our key metric, email submission, was not meeting our goal. While exploring analytics I found that our successful users started to engage with the product in the way that we intended after two or three minutes of use. This is a very long time to maintain user attention and interest and it is much more likely a user would bounce in that time than stick around and learn something new.
        </p>
        <h5>Solving The Issue:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          In order for us to collect emails, we needed users to save an itinerary, which, as explained above, takes a good bit of effort.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          We now knew we needed to create alternative reasons for users to provide their emails sooner, along with showing them value before reaching the day creation tool. We decided to implement features that users are accustom to seeing in our industry, giving them comfort in familiarity.
        </p>
        <h5>New Features:</h5>
        <p class="m-x m-t-0">
          In creating the new features we wanted to help acquisition along with boosting our engagement and retention metrics.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          With acquisition in mind, we created event pages, venue pages and “Best Things to do…” type blogs. These pages not only function as attractive content for advertising and sharing on social media platforms but also succeeded in dramatically increasing our SEO, giving us some page one results on Google.
        </p>
        <p class="m-x">
          Focusing on retention, we created a weekly email to send users the best events for each week and the ability to “favorite” events, blogs, and venues to a user dashboard for later day planning. Favoriting any piece of content requires a user to sign up and provide an email.
        </p>
